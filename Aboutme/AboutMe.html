        <h1>Something about me...</h1>
        <p> I am a daughter, sister, wife, mother, friend ... born and raised in my beautiful Macedonia (Europe). 
            One decade ago life took us to USA Chicago ( The land of the free, and the land of the brave), Here with my husband we started to build our new life from scratch.
            After 8 years of being a stay-at-home mom, for my 2 boys (which i love endlessly of course:) i decided is time to come back professionally but i want to work on something that will fulfill ME and my dreams. 
            After long research, the missing puzzle i discovered was in the UX/UI field.  Art and design in different fields and shapes have always been my passion and part of my life. 
            I immediately was attached and i like the UX/UI because i believe everything has roots and can grow every day with care, and love.. Same with the design, every project with a good UX base, and with love, care, and commitment can grow into great UI design that the users will love and enjoy. 
            In my free time, i love to spend every moment with my lovely family, we love to walk in Nature, where i take A LOT of photographs, i love books, i love to cook and bake for my family and friends, I love crafts, quilling, rock painting, making jewelry, i love Antic, history, and mystery...  i love Life and design!
        </p>
