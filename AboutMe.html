        <h1>Something about me...</h1>
        <p>I am a daughter, sister, wife, mother, friend ... born and raised in my beautiful Macedonia (Europe). 
          <br/> One decade ago life took us to USA Chicago ( The land of the free, and the land of the brave), Here with my husband we started to build our new life from scratch.
          <br/>After 8 years of being a stay-at-home mom, for my 2 boys (which I love endlessly of course:) I decided is time to come back professionally but I want to work on something that will fulfill ME and my dreams. 
           <br/>After a long research, the missing puzzle I discovered was in the UX/UI field.  Art and design in different fields and shapes have always been my passion and part of my life. 
           <br/>I immediately was attached and I like the UX/UI and the endless creativity in different fields...And the UX research before everything I LOVE IT because I believe everything has roots and can grow every day with care, and love... Same with the design, every project with a good UX base, and with love, care, and commitment can grow into great UI design that the users will love and enjoy. 
          <br/> In my free time, I love to spend every moment with my lovely family, we love to walk in Nature, where I take A LOT of photographs, I love books, I love to cook and bake for my family and friends, I love crafts, quilling, rock painting, making jewelry, I love Antic, history, and mystery...  
<br/>I love Life and design!
        </p>
